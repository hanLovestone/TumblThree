## Application Usage:

* extract the .zip file and run the application by double clicking TumblThree.exe.
* Copy the url of any tumblr.com blog you want to backup from into the textbox at the bottom left. Afterwards, click on 'Add Blog' on the right side of it.
* Alternatively, if you copy (ctrl-c) a _tumblr.com_ blog url from the address bar/a text file, the clipboard monitor from TumblThree will detect it and automatically add the blog.
* To start the download process, click on 'Crawl'. The application will regularly check for (new) blogs in the queue and start processing them, until you stop the application by pressing 'Stop'. So, you can either add blogs to the queue via 'Add to Queue' or double click first and then click 'Crawl', or you start the download process first and add blogs to the queue afterwards.
* A light blue bar left to the blog in the queue indicates a actively downloading blog.
* The blog manager on the left side also indicates the state of each blog. A red background shows an offline blog, a green background an actively crawling blog and a purple background an enqueued blog.
* You change the download location, the number of concurrent connections, the default backup settings for each newly added blog and various other settings in the 'Settings'. 
* In the Details window you can view statistics of your blog and set blog specific options. You can here what kind of post type (photo, video, audio, text, conversation, quote, link) to download.
* For downloading only tagged posts, you'll have to do some steps:
  1. Add the blog url.
  2. Open the blog in the details tab, enter the tags in the Tags textbox in a comma separated list without the leading hash (#) sign. E.g. _great big car,bears_ would search for images that are tagged for either a _great big car_ or _bears_ or both.
* For downloading password protected blogs, you'll have to do some steps:
  1. Add the blog url.
  2. Open the blog in the details tab, enter the password in the Password textbox.
* For downloading hidden blogs (login required blogs), you have to do some steps:
  1. Go to Settings, click on the Connection tab and fill in your tumblr email address (login) and password, then click the Authenticate button. If the login was successfully, the label will change and display your email address. The email address and password are not stored locally on disk but cookies are generated and saved in _%LOCALAPPDATA%\TumblThree_ in json format.
  2. Add the blog url.
* For downloading liked photos and videos, you'll have to do some steps:
  1. Go to Settings, click on the Connection tab and fill in your tumblr email address (login) and password, then click the Authenticate button. If the login was successfully, the label will change and display your email address. The email address and password are not stored locally on disk but cookies are generated and saved in _%LOCALAPPDATA%\TumblThree_ in json format.
  2. Add the blog url including the liked/by string in the url (e.g. https://www.tumblr.com/liked/by/wallpaperfx/).
  3. For downloading your own likes, make sure you've (temporarily) enabled the following options in your blogs settings (i.e. https://www.tumblr.com/settings/blog/yourblogname):
      * Likes -> Share posts you like (to enable the publicly visible liked/by page)
      * Visibility -> _blog_ is explicit (to see/download NSFW likes)
* For downloading photos and videos from the tumblr search, you'll have to do some steps:
  1. Add the search url including your key words separated by plus signs (+) in the url (e.g. https://www.tumblr.com/search/my+special+tags).
* For downloading photos and videos from the tumblr tag search, you'll have to do some steps:
  1. Go to Settings, click on the Connection tab and fill in your tumblr email address (login) and password, then click the Authenticate button. If the login was successfully, the label will change and display your email address. The email address and password are not stored locally on disk but cookies are generated and saved in _%LOCALAPPDATA%\TumblThree_ in json format.
  2. Add the search url including your tags separated by plus signs (+) in the url (e.g. https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/my+special+tags).

## Getting Started:

The default settings should cover most users. You should only have to change the download location and the kind of posts you want to download. For this, in the Settings (click on the Settings button in the lower panel of the main user interface) you might want to change:
* General -> Download location: Specifies where to download the files. The default is in a folder _Blogs_ relative to the TumblThree.exe
* Blog -> Settings applied to each blog upon addition:
  * Here you can set what posts newly added blogs will download per default. To change what each blog downloads, click on a blog in the main interface, select the Details Tab on the right and change the settings. This separation allows to download different kind of post for different blogs. You can change the download settings for multiple existing blogs by selecting them with shift+left click for a range or ctrl-a for all of them.
  * Note: You might want to always select:
    *  _Download Reblogged posts_: Downloads reblogs, not just original content of the blog author.

Settings you might want to change if the download speed is not satisfactory:
* Connection -> Concurrent connections: Specifies the number of connections used for downloading posts. The number is shared between all actively downloading blogs.
* Connection -> Concurrent video connections: Specifies the number of connections used for downloading tumblr video posts. The vt.tumblr.com host regularly closes connections if the number is too high. Thus, the maximum number of vt.tumblr.com connections can be specified here independently.
* Connection -> Concurrent blogs: Number of blogs to download in parallel.

Most likely you don't have to change any of the other connection settings. In particular, settings you should never change, unless you're sure you know what you are doing:
* Connection -> Limit Tumblr Api Connections: Leave this checkbox checked and do not change the corresponding values of 90 connections per 60 seconds. If you still change them, you might end up with offline blogs or missing downloads.

## Further Insights:

* _Note:_ All the follwing files are stored in json format and can be opened in any editor.
* Application settings are stored in _C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\TumblThree\\_. 
* You can use the _portable mode_ (settings->general) to stores the application settings in the same folder as the executable.
* For each blog there is also a database (serialized class) file in the _Index_ folder of the download location named after the _blogname_.tumblr. Here blog relative information is stored like what files have been downloaded, the url of the blog and when it was added. This allows you to move your downloaded files (photos, videos, audio files) to a different location without interfering with the download process.
* Some settings aren't hooked up to the graphical user interface. It's possible to view all TumblThree settings by opening the settings.json in any editor located in _C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\TumblThree\\_. Their names should be self explainatory. Some notable settings to further fine tune the application include:
  * BufferSize: Allows to set the buffer size for downloading binary files (photos, videos) in multiples of 4KB. The default is 2MB, thus the BufferSize has a value of 512. Increasing this value reduces disk fragmentation as more of the file is kept in the memory before it gets written out to the disk but increases the memory usage.
  * MaxNumberOfRetries: Sets the maximum number of retries if a tumblr server forcefully closes the connection. This might regularly happen on the tumblr video host (vt.tumblr.com) if too many connections were opened in parallel. After the limit is exhausted, the file is left truncated, but is also not registered as a successful downloaded. Thus, the file can be resumed in the next crawl.
  * TumblrHosts: Contains a list of hosts which is tried for downloading \_raw photos if the photo size is set to _raw_. If none of the hosts contains the \_raw version, the actually scanned host is tried with the next lower resolution (1028). 

## Limitations:

* The old datasets from TumblTwo and TumblOne are __not__ compatible.
* No more support for Windows XP.
 
## How To Build The Source Code To Help Further Developing:

* Download [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/). The minimum required version is Visual Studio 2015 (C# 6.0 feature support). You also need _Blend for Visual Studio SDK for .NET_ which includes the System.Windows.Interactivity and Microsoft.Expression.Interactions .dlls.
* Download the [source code as .zip file](https://github.com/johanneszab/TumblThree/archive/master.zip) or use the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [checkout the code](https://github.com/johanneszab/TumblThree.git).
* Open the TumblThree.sln solution file in the src/ directory of the code.
* Build the Source once before editing anything. Build->Build Solution.

## Translations wanted:

* If you want to help translate TumblThree, there are two resource files (.resx) which contain all the strings used in the application. One for [the user interface](https://github.com/johanneszab/TumblThree/blob/master/src/TumblThree/TumblThree.Presentation/Properties/Resources.resx#L120) and one for the [underlying application](https://github.com/johanneszab/TumblThree/blob/master/src/TumblThree/TumblThree.Applications/Properties/Resources.resx#L120).  
* Translate all the words or its meanings between the two value tags and create a pull request on github or simply send me the files via email.
